        <p>
            I have over 20 years of experience performing, teaching, accompanying, 
            and playing the piano. My extensive experience has allowed me to 
            develop a strong understanding of music theory and performance 
            techniques. I am also skilled in working with students of all ages and 
            levels, as well as collaborating with other musicians. My passion for 
            the piano and music has only grown over the years, and I am eager to 
            share my knowledge and skills with others.
