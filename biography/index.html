            <p>
                Tetyana Guthrie has been studying the piano since the age of five 
                in the Ukraine, and has participated in multiple competitions as a 
                soloist, and as part of collaborative ensembles with violinists, 
                cellists and vocalists. 

                <br/><br/>

                Over the course of her career she has been trained by many 
                outstanding pianists, including Dr. Mykola Suk, a highly acclaimed 
                Ukrainian-American pianist who is currently teaching at UNLV. After 
                completing her graduate studies at Denver University's Lamont 
                School of Music, under the direction of Stephanie Cheng, she served 
                as a graduate teacher assistant during that time. While at the 
                University of Denver, she taught students at many skill levels.
                
                <br/><br/>

                Her professional background has allowed her to acquire a wealth of 
                experience, which she utilized in her Masters Thesis, where she 
                examined the distinctions between traditional and contemporary 
                piano techniques.

                <br/><br/>
                
                She holds both a Master of Music and Master of Education degree, as 
                well as an active Teaching License in the state of Colorado.

                <br/><br/>

                With her extensive classical training, she now applies multiple 
                piano techniques and methods to ensure the success of her students. 
                
                <br/><br/>

                Tetyana is currently accepting new piano students.
